ByChance
========

The ByChance Framework allows game developers to provide an infinite amount of unique levels for both 2D and 3D games. Easy to integrate into video games of all genres, ByChance enables you to generate complex levels including all of their game components and comes with useful post-processing algorithms that can be applied afterwards in order to ensure a great gaming experience.


## Getting Started

The core of the ByChance Framework is a generic level generation algorithm that is able to construct 2D and 3D levels alike. Thus, you only need to understand the framework fundamentals once, and will then be able to create levels for games of all genres.

ByChance is a .NET Framework class library written in C# that follows the .NET patterns and idoms presented in the book *Framework Design Guidelines* by Cwalina, Abrams et al. This page will explain the basics of integrating the ByChance Framework for creating random levels in your games. All code samples are written in C#.
